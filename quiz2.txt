Great, let's summarize and expand on the information you've provided about music therapy (MT) and its outcomes, especially concerning the elderly and those with dementia.

Research into Outcomes of Music Therapy (MT)
Elderly and Group Music Therapy:
Enhancement of Socialization and Communication: Group MT sessions help reduce isolation by encouraging social interaction and communication among elderly participants.
Muscular Stimulation and Motor Skills: MT activities can improve both fine and gross motor skills, aiding physical health and coordination.
MT Interventions in Dementia Care
Singing: Engaging in singing familiar songs can improve memory recall and cognitive function.
Improvisation: Allows for creative expression and emotional release, fostering a sense of spontaneity and engagement.
Playing Instruments (e.g., Bell Choir): Participating in instrumental activities can enhance coordination, timing, and social interaction.
Songwriting: Provides an outlet for self-expression, creativity, and communication of personal experiences and emotions.
Pre-composed Music
Powerful Tool: Pre-composed music is familiar and can evoke strong emotional and cognitive responses due to its connection to personal memories and experiences.

MT Interventions with Pre-composed Music:

Singing: Promotes engagement, memory recall, and social interaction.
Playing Instruments: Enhances motor skills and provides a sense of accomplishment.
Listening: Can reduce anxiety, improve mood, and provide cognitive stimulation.
Improvisation: Encourages creativity and emotional expression.
Benefits of Pre-composed Music:

Oxygen Saturation: Singing and breathing exercises can improve respiratory function.
Movement: Rhythmic music can stimulate physical activity and coordination.
Empowerment: Participating in music-making fosters a sense of control and achievement.
Quality of Life (QOL): Overall well-being is enhanced through emotional, cognitive, and social benefits.
Communication: Music provides alternative ways to express and understand emotions and thoughts.
Entertainment vs. Music Therapy
Distinction: While both may involve singing and playing music, MT is structured and goal-oriented, designed to achieve therapeutic outcomes.
Sing-a-long vs. MT: MT uses specific techniques to address clinical goals, whereas a sing-a-long is typically for enjoyment without therapeutic intent.
Familiarity and Predictable Music (ABA - e.g., "Que Sera Sera"): Using well-known songs can provide a sense of security, empowerment, and confidence, helping to evoke memories and stimulate conversations.
Use of Meaningful Music: Class Example
Earliest Music Memory: Recalling the earliest music memory can be a powerful exercise in connecting with one's past and evoking emotions.
Writing Down the Memory: Documenting these memories helps in processing and sharing personal experiences.
Music Timeline: Creating a timeline of significant musical experiences throughout one‚Äôs life can illustrate the personal and emotional impact of music over time.

‚Ä¢ A temporal locking process in which one system's motion entrains the frequency of
another system. This process is a universal phenomenon that can be observed in
physical (e.g., pendulum clocks) and biological systems (e.g., fire flies).
‚Ä¢ Mathematical models have shown that anticipatory rhythmic templates as critical time
constraints can result in the complete specification of the dynamics of a movement over
the entire movement cycle, thereby optimizing motor planning and execution.

USING MIDAS
Visual Analogue Scales
MiDAS uses Visual Analogue Scales (VAS) without anchor points. Each VAS comprises a 100mm line without intervals, with the two extremes of the scale labelled as ‚Äònone at all‚Äô and ‚Äòhighest‚Äô. ‚ÄòHighest‚Äô meaning the optimal level that the unique individual with dementia can achieve at that stage of their life. This means that as the person‚Äôs dementia progresses, their optimal level is also likely to change. Since each person‚Äôs optimal level is different, a MiDAS rater needs to know the person they are scoring sufficiently well.

How to use MiDAS
MiDAS is an observational outcome measure to be independently completed by a music therapist and a staff member who provides daily care to the person with dementia. It is a same-day-scale so both therapist‚Äôs forms and staff forms should be completed on the day of the session.

Before the session starts, the staff rater who provides daily care to the resident with dementia takes a moment, reflects on the resident‚Äôs overall wellbeing on that day, and completes the Before form.
Immediately after the session, the therapist completes two MiDAS forms: Beginning and During. The Beginning rating is based on the observation of a client during the first approximately five minutes of the session as a baseline score for that day. The During form is completed based on the observation of the client during his/her ‚Äòbest five minutes‚Äô of that session. The ‚Äòbest five minutes‚Äô implies the section of the session that therapist judged as most clinically important for the particular client on the day. Since each client‚Äôs therapy process and their relationships with therapists are unique, we did not indicate what should be considered as the ‚Äòbest five minutes‚Äô, but left to clinical judgement of each therapist.
The staff member who completed the Before form completes the After form after several hours after the session on the same day. It is important that the After form is not completed immediately after the session, when it is likely to see the immediate impact of the session. Completing the After form several hours later the session enables us to evaluate short-term (same-day) effect of the intervention.
The completed MiDAS forms are manually measured with a ruler and scores of each VAS are recorded accordingly.
How to interpret completed MiDAS forms
The total scores of the five VAS items (100mm-line = score 100 x five VAS items = 500) are reported as the MiDAS scores. However, it is also important to record and evaluate the changes in individual VAS scores according to the severity of the person‚Äôs dementia and his/her abilities and needs. For example, for the person with advanced dementia with very limited mobility who often falls asleep, it is probably not realistic to expect consistently increasing Initiation or Involvement scores. However, increased Interest or Response during or after the session may be observable. Consistently decreasing MiDAS over weeks could be an indication the person is not benefitting from the intervention, or, his/her dementia is progressing. MiDAS is useful to evaluate changes over time as well as the short-term impact of an intervention but interpretation of MiDAS scores always needs to be clinically contextualised.

Note on training new MiDAS raters and the importance of regular raters
There is no need to attend training sessions to use MiDAS forms. However, we encourage more experienced MiDAS raters to provide introductory/practice session to new raters when implementing in clinical practice. It is extremely important new raters understand the concept of Visual Analogue Scales as an observational measure. Our study found that some staff members struggled to stop and reflect about the person, and/or to conceptualise the optimum level of a unique individual. Although it is often difficult to identify staff members who are able to complete MiDAS forms, it is important to aim for finding regular raters, since frequent changes in staff MiDAS raters would impact on trustworthiness of MiDAS score changes due to the subjective nature of completing Visual Analogue Scales.

MiDAS (Music in Dementia Assessment Scales)
Overview:
MiDAS is an observational outcome measure designed to evaluate the impact of music therapy on individuals with dementia. It uses Visual Analogue Scales (VAS) to capture changes in well-being, with the unique aspect of having no anchor points on the 100mm line scale.

Components of MiDAS
Visual Analogue Scales (VAS):

Format: 100mm line without intervals.
Labels: Extremes are labelled as ‚Äònone at all‚Äô and ‚Äòhighest‚Äô.
'Highest': Optimal level that an individual with dementia can achieve at their current stage.
Personalization: Optimal levels vary per individual and can change as dementia progresses.
Scoring: MiDAS raters must know the individual well to accurately score.
Using MiDAS
Steps for Completion:

Before the Session:

The staff member who provides daily care completes the 'Before' form reflecting on the resident‚Äôs overall well-being for the day.
During the Session:

Beginning Form: The music therapist observes the client during the first five minutes of the session and completes this as a baseline.
During Form: The therapist assesses the client's 'best five minutes' of the session. This is based on clinical judgment regarding the most important part of the session for the client.
After the Session:

Several hours post-session, the same staff member completes the 'After' form to evaluate the short-term effects of the session, ensuring immediate impacts do not bias the evaluation.
Scoring:

Completed forms are measured with a ruler to record the scores.
Total Score: Sum of five VAS items, each up to 100mm, resulting in a maximum score of 500.
Interpretation:
Consider both total and individual VAS item changes.
Contextualize scores according to the severity of dementia and individual abilities/needs.
Track changes over time to assess benefits and the progression of dementia.
Interpretation of MiDAS Scores
Trends: Consistent decrease may indicate lack of benefit or progression of dementia.
Clinical Context: Always interpret scores with consideration to the clinical context of each individual.
Training and Regular Raters
No Formal Training Required: However, experienced MiDAS raters should mentor new raters.
Regular Raters: Important to have consistent raters to maintain the trustworthiness of the scores.
Challenges: Some staff may struggle with the concept of VAS and reflecting on optimal levels.
Benefits of MiDAS
Individualized Assessment: Tailored to the unique progress and abilities of each person with dementia.
Short-term and Long-term Evaluation: Useful for evaluating immediate effects and long-term changes due to music therapy interventions.
By ensuring that staff members and music therapists understand and accurately use MiDAS, the tool can effectively measure and contribute to the improvement of the quality of life for individuals with dementia through personalized music therapy interventions.

12.1 Gerontology and the Concept of Aging
Learning Objectives
Describe why it is important to understand age and aging.
Distinguish biological aging, psychological aging, and social aging.
The United States is far removed from the world of the San, but changes that have been occurring in this nation are also affecting its older citizens. For example, the numbers of older Americans are growing rapidly, with important repercussions for economic and social life. Somewhat like the San, we appreciate our elderly but also consider them something of a burden. We also hold some unfortunate stereotypes of them and seemingly view old age as something to be shunned. Television commercials and other advertisements extol the virtues of staying young by ‚Äúwashing away the gray‚Äù and by removing all facial wrinkles. In our youth-obsessed culture, older people seem to be second-class citizens.

Why study the elderly and the process of growing old? As just noted, understanding the elderly and the experience of aging will help us understand a society. An additional reason might be even more convincing: you will be old someday. At least you will be old if you do not die prematurely from an accident, cancer, a heart attack, some other medical problem, murder, or suicide. Although we do not often think about aging when we are in our late teens and early 20s, one of our major goals in life is to become old. That is partly why many people wear seat belts, watch their diets, and exercise. By studying age and aging and becoming familiar with some of the problems facing the elderly now and in the future, we are really studying something about ourselves and a stage in the life course we all hope to reach.

The study of aging is so important and popular that it has its own name, gerontology. Social gerontology is the study of the social aspects of aging (Hooyman & Kiyak, 2011).The scholars who study aging are called gerontologists. The people they study go by several names, most commonly ‚Äúolder people,‚Äù ‚Äúelders,‚Äù and ‚Äúthe elderly.‚Äù The latter term is usually reserved for those 65 or older, while ‚Äúolder people‚Äù and ‚Äúelders‚Äù (as the headline of the opening news story illustrates) often include people in their 50s as well as those 60 or older.

Gerontologists say that age and aging have at least four dimensions. The dimension most of us think of is chronological age, defined as the number of years since someone was born. A second dimension is biological aging, which refers to the physical changes that ‚Äúslow us down‚Äù as we get into our middle and older years. For example, our arteries might clog up, or problems with our lungs might make it more difficult for us to breathe. A third dimension, psychological aging, refers to the psychological changes, including those involving mental functioning and personality, that occur as we age. Gerontologists emphasize that chronological age is not always the same thing as biological or psychological age. Some people who are 65, for example, can look and act much younger than some who are 50.

The fourth dimension of aging is social. Social aging refers to changes in a person‚Äôs roles and relationships, both within their networks of relatives and friends and in formal organizations such as the workplace and houses of worship. Although social aging can differ from one individual to another, it is also profoundly influenced by the perception of aging that is part of a society‚Äôs culture. If a society views aging positively, the social aging experienced by individuals in that society will be more positive and enjoyable than in a society that views aging negatively. Let‚Äôs look at the perception of aging in more detail.

Key Takeaways
The study of elderly and the aging helps us understand the society in which we live, and it also alerts us to certain processes and problems that we may experience as we grow into old age.
Biological aging refers to the physical changes that accompany the aging process, while psychological aging refers to the psychological changes that occur.
Social aging refers to the changes in a person‚Äôs roles and relationships as the person ages.
For Your Review
Think about an older person whom you know. To what extent has this person experienced psychological aging? To what extent has this person experienced social aging?

12.1 Gerontology and the Concept of Aging
Learning Objectives
Describe why it is important to understand age and aging.
Distinguish biological aging, psychological aging, and social aging.
Introduction to Aging and Gerontology
The United States is witnessing rapid growth in its older population, leading to significant economic and social implications. Despite recognizing the value of elderly citizens, society often regards them as burdensome and holds negative stereotypes about aging. Advertisements promoting youthfulness reflect a cultural obsession with staying young, relegating older individuals to a secondary status.

Importance of Studying Aging
Understanding aging is crucial for comprehending societal dynamics and preparing for our own aging process. The study of age and aging, known as gerontology, and specifically its social aspects (social gerontology), helps us address issues facing the elderly and anticipate our future challenges.

Key Concepts in Aging
Dimensions of Aging
Gerontologists identify four key dimensions of aging:

Chronological Age: The number of years since birth.
Biological Aging: Physical changes that slow us down with age, such as clogged arteries or reduced lung function.
Psychological Aging: Changes in mental functioning and personality as we age.
Social Aging: Changes in roles and relationships within personal networks and formal organizations, influenced by societal perceptions of aging.
The Perception of Aging
Societal views on aging significantly impact the experience of aging. Positive perceptions lead to more enjoyable social aging experiences, while negative perceptions can lead to more challenging experiences.

Key Takeaways
Studying aging helps us understand societal dynamics and prepares us for our own aging process.
Biological Aging: Physical changes associated with aging.
Psychological Aging: Mental and personality changes with age.
Social Aging: Changes in roles and relationships as a person ages.
For Your Review
Reflect on an older person you know. Consider the following:

Psychological Aging: How have their mental functioning and personality changed?
Social Aging: How have their roles and relationships evolved?
By analyzing these aspects, we can better understand the multifaceted nature of aging and its impact on individuals and society.

Background: Dementia is a neurological condition characterized by deterioration in
cognitive, behavioral, social, and emotional functions. Pharmacological interventions
are available but have limited effect in treating many of the disease‚Äôs features. Several
studies have proposed therapy with music as a possible strategy to slow down
cognitive decline and behavioral changes associated with aging in combination with the
pharmacological therapy.
Objective: We performed a systematic review and subsequent meta-analysis to check
whether the application of music therapy in people living with dementia has an effect on
cognitive function, quality of life, and/or depressive state.
Methods: The databases used were Medline, PubMed Central, Embase, PsycINFO,
and the Cochrane Library. The search was made up of all the literature until present. For
the search, key terms, such as ‚Äúmusic,‚Äù ‚Äúbrain,‚Äù ‚Äúdementia,‚Äù or ‚Äúclinical trial,‚Äù were used.
Results: Finally, a total of eight studies were included. All the studies have an acceptable
quality based on the score on the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) and Critical
Appraisal Skills Program (CASP) scales. After meta-analysis, it was shown that the
intervention with music improves cognitive function in people living with dementia, as
well as quality of life after the intervention and long-term depression. Nevertheless,
no evidence was shown of improvement of quality of life in long-term and short-
term depression.
Conclusion: Based on our results, music could be a powerful treatment strategy.
However, it is necessary to develop clinical trials aimed to design standardized protocols
depending on the nature or stage of dementia so that they can be applied together with
current cognitive-behavioral and pharmacological therapies.

KEY POINTS
‚Ä¢ Music therapy is used as a treatment for the improvement of
cognitive function in people with dementia.
‚Ä¢ The intervention based on listening to music presents the
greatest effect on patients with dementia followed by singing.
‚Ä¢ Music therapy improved the quality of life of people

associated with dementia.
INTRODUCTION
Approximately 50 million people worldwide have dementia,
and it is projected to almost triple by 2050 (1). Dementia
is an overall term for diseases and conditions characterized
by progressive affectation of cognitive alterations, such as
memory and language, as well as behavioral alterations including
depression and anxiety (2, 3). In order to ameliorate the
symptoms of dementia, different intervention approaches, both
pharmacological and non-pharmacological, have been trialed.
Pharmacological interventions, such as acetylcholinesterase
inhibitors, are mainly aimed to treat cognitive symptoms but
without avoiding the course of the disease. Unfortunately,
these therapies have limited effect on alleviating behavioral and
psychological symptoms of dementia (2, 4). On the other hand,
non-pharmacological interventions can provide complementary
therapy, offering versatile approaches to improve outcomes
for people living with dementia and minimize behavioral
occurrences as well as to improve or sustain quality of life (2, 5‚Äì
9). There are many types of non-pharmacological approaches,
such as psychosocial and educational therapies (either with
individuals or in groups) and physical or sensorial activities
(music, therapeutic touch, and multisensory stimuli) (7, 10‚Äì
12). In particular, music therapy is thoroughly used in daily
clinical practice in case of dementia (13, 14). Many authors
emphasize the positive effects of music on the brain. In this
sense, several studies showed that people with dementia enjoy
music, and their ability to respond to it is preserved even
when verbal communication is no longer possible. These studies
claimed that interventions based on musical activities have
positive effects on behavior, emotion and cognition (2, 15, 16).
Therefore, studying and playing music alter brain function and
can improve cognitive areas, such as the neural mechanisms for
speech (17), learning, attention (18), and memory (19). Music
can also activate subcortical circuits, the limbic system, and
the emotional reward system, provoking sensations of welfare
and pleasure (14). In this regard, long-term musical training
and learning of associated skills can be a strong stimulus for
neuroplastic changes, in both the developing brain and the adult
brain. These findings suggest the great capacity of music to
enhance cerebral plasticity (13, 16, 20). Contrariwise, there are
studies that question the specific effect of music therapy on
people with dementia (21). With this background, the aim of
this study is to analyze from an unbiased approach the effect of
music therapy on the cognitive function, quality of life, and/or
depressive state in people living with dementia.
FIGURE 1 | Flow of studies through the review process for systematic review
and meta-analysis.
METHODS
Search Strategy and Selection Criteria
A systematic review was conducted following the
recommendations of the Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) (Figure 1
and Searching procedure of Supplementary Data) (22). An
independent literature search was conducted across Medline,
PubMed Central, Embase, PsycINFO, and Cochrane library
Frontiers in Medicine | www.frontiersin.org 2 May 2020 | Volume 7 | Article 160
Moreno-Morales et al. Meta-Analyisis Music Therapy in Dementia
databases. We carried out the systematic review of the literature
following a series of criteria as detailed below.
Initially, the search began with the terms ‚Äúbrain‚Äù and ‚Äúmusic.‚Äù
Later, ‚Äúdementia‚Äù was added, and finally, ‚Äúclinical trial‚Äù was
included. The search period used was from 1990 to present.
Next, a more in-depth study of selected trials was carried out.
Duplicate studies were removed. All studies that compared any
form and method of musical intervention with an intervention
without music were evaluated. Lastly, those studies that were
systematic analysis, reviews, and study protocols and those
which do not evaluate cognitive function were excluded. All
the trials chosen were designed as randomized controlled
trials (RCTs).
Data Collection, Extraction, and
Quality Assessment
Two authors (CMM and PMM) independently assessed
publications for eligibility. Discrepancies or difficulties were
discussed with a third review author (CP). Data were collected
independently using a standardized data extraction form in order
to summarize the characteristics of the studies and outcome
data (23).
From each individual study, we extracted baseline
information: publication and year, study design, participants
(number, age, and sex ratio), Mini-Mental Status Examination
(MMSE) score, and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) (clinical
evaluation of dementia) when possible, as well as the design of
each individual study (intervention method, frequency, duration,
and time of evaluation of the results) (Table 1).
In addition, at the beginning of the study, we assessed
the quality of meta-analysis-included studies using the
Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) scale and the
Critical Appraisal Skills Program (CASP) scale (Supplementary
Tables 1, 2 of the Supplementary Data) (23, 32, 33).
Outcome Measures
The primary outcome defined to be compared was cognitive
function evaluated through MMSE (34), Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease
Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog) (35), Revised
Memory and Behavior Problems Checklist (RMBPC) (36),
or Immediate and Deferred Prose Memory test (MPI and
MPD, respectively) (37). Other comparative results, named
as secondary outcomes, were quality of life, assessed through
Quality of Life in Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease (QOL-AD) (38), and
depression, evaluated through Cornell‚ÄìBrown Scale for Quality
of Life in Dementia (CBS) and Geriatric Depression Scale
(GDS) (39, 40).
Statistical Analysis: Meta-Analysis
First, a comparison was made using the random-effects model.
All outcomes were continuous variables [mean ¬± standard
deviation (SD) of the change in the score before and after the
therapy in the different diagnostic tests], and the standardized
mean difference (SMD) was analyzed. All the analyses were
carried out considering a confidence interval (CI) of 95%.
Statistical heterogeneity was also tested by I2. I2 < 25% was
identified as low heterogeneity (41, 42). Finally, the publication
bias was evaluated using funnel plot graphs (43, 44). To further
investigate the heterogeneity, meta-regression and subgroup
analyses were performed to assess the primary outcome data
and associations according to the method of intervention
(interactive and passive), trial period, number of sessions per
week, and effect of evaluation method used. The P values
in the meta-regression revealed the overall significance of the
influence factors.
Meta-analysis, heterogeneity study, and graphical
representations were performed using R with the Metafor
package (44). To digitize graphics and obtain numerical data
from those trials that did not provide them, the GetData
Graph Digitizer program (Getdata-graph-digitizer.com)
was used.
RESULTS
Baseline Characteristics
Results of initial search and exclusions are shown in Figure 1.
A thorough reading of each article was carried out, and a
summary of each of them is shown in Table 1. Therefore,
we finally stayed for the systematic review and meta-analysis
with eight articles. The size of the studies was between 30
and 201 subjects, with a total of 816 subjects with mild to
severe dementia, assigned randomly to both the intervention and
control groups. All the people in the trials stayed in nursing
homes or hospitals. S√§rk√§m√∂ et al. divided the participants
into three groups, an active group that sang, a passive group
that listened to music, and a control group (24, 25). On
the other hand, Doi et al. evaluated two cognitive programs
of leisure activities: dancing and playing musical instruments
(26). Furthermore, Han et al. tested a multimodal cognitive
improvement therapy (MCET) consisting of cognitive training,
cognitive stimulation, reality orientation, physical, reminiscence,
and music therapy against a sham therapy without music
(27). In this line, Ceccato et al. tried the program Sound
Training for Attention and Memory in Dementia (STAM-Dem),
a manualized music-based protocol designed to be used in the
rehabilitation of cognitive functions in people with dementia.
Those in the control group continued with the normal ‚Äústandard
care‚Äù provided (28). While Lyu et al. compared the effect of
singing on cognitive function and mood, Chu et al. assessed
a protocol that includes playing an instrument, dancing, and
listening to music. The effect size of all those studies reveals a
general improvement in the results of the experimental group
(29, 30). Finally, Gu√©tin et al. did not find a significant difference
between the experimental and control groups when evaluating
the cognitive function after an 18-month therapy based on
listening to music (31).
All the studies had an acceptable quality as confirmed after
applying the PEDro and CASP scales (Supplementary Tables 1,
2, respectively, of the Supplementary Data).
In case of medication (dementia, antipsychotic, and
antidepressant medication and sedative or sleeping medication),
it must have been stable prior to the trial. Since participants were
randomized, there were no significant differences between the
control and music-treated groups with regard to medication.

Background and Objectives
Dementia is a complex neurological condition characterized by the deterioration of cognitive, behavioral, social, and emotional functions. Pharmacological treatments are available but offer limited relief for many of the disease's features. Music therapy (MT) has been proposed as a complementary strategy to slow cognitive decline and mitigate behavioral changes associated with dementia. This systematic review and meta-analysis aim to assess the effects of MT on cognitive function, quality of life (QoL), and depressive symptoms in individuals with dementia.

Methods
The databases used for the review were Medline, PubMed Central, Embase, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Library, covering all relevant literature up to the present. The search included key terms such as "music," "brain," "dementia," and "clinical trial." Studies included in the review were evaluated using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) and Critical Appraisal Skills Program (CASP) scales for quality. The analysis included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing MT interventions with non-music interventions.

Results
Eight studies with acceptable quality were included in the meta-analysis, involving a total of 816 subjects with mild to severe dementia. These studies were conducted in nursing homes or hospitals and involved various forms of MT, including listening to music, singing, and playing musical instruments.

Key Findings:
Cognitive Function: MT showed significant improvement in cognitive function in individuals with dementia.
Quality of Life: MT improved QoL immediately after the intervention.
Depressive Symptoms: MT had a long-term positive effect on depression symptoms but did not show immediate improvements in QoL or short-term depressive symptoms.
Conclusion
The meta-analysis supports the use of MT as a beneficial treatment strategy for cognitive function, QoL, and long-term depression in people with dementia. However, further research is needed to develop standardized MT protocols tailored to the nature and stage of dementia for integration with current therapies.

Key Points
Effectiveness of MT: MT is effective in improving cognitive function and QoL in dementia patients.
Intervention Methods: Listening to music has the greatest effect, followed by singing.
Depression: MT has a sustained positive impact on depression symptoms.
Need for Standardization: There is a need for well-designed clinical trials to standardize MT protocols.
Introduction
Dementia affects approximately 50 million people worldwide, with numbers expected to nearly triple by 2050. It encompasses a range of symptoms, including memory and language deterioration, as well as behavioral issues like depression and anxiety. While pharmacological treatments target cognitive symptoms, their efficacy on behavioral and psychological symptoms is limited. Non-pharmacological interventions, such as MT, offer complementary approaches to enhance patient outcomes and QoL.

Methods
Search Strategy and Selection Criteria
A systematic review following PRISMA guidelines was conducted across multiple databases. The search focused on studies from 1990 to the present, involving RCTs that compared musical interventions with non-music controls.

Data Collection and Quality Assessment
Data were independently collected by two authors, with discrepancies resolved by a third author. The studies were assessed for quality using PEDro and CASP scales. Primary outcomes included cognitive function (evaluated through MMSE, ADAS-Cog, RMBPC, or MPI/MPD) and secondary outcomes included QoL (assessed through QOL-AD) and depression (evaluated through CBS and GDS).

Statistical Analysis
A meta-analysis using the random-effects model was performed, analyzing continuous variables (mean ¬± SD) with a 95% CI. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed, and publication bias was evaluated using funnel plots.

Results
Study Characteristics
The final analysis included eight RCTs with a total of 816 participants. Interventions varied from active participation (singing, playing instruments) to passive participation (listening to music). Despite differences in methodology, all studies indicated some level of benefit from MT.

Meta-Analysis Findings
Cognitive Function: MT significantly improved cognitive scores across studies.
Quality of Life: Immediate improvements in QoL were noted post-intervention, but not long-term.
Depressive Symptoms: MT had a lasting positive effect on depression symptoms.
Conclusion
MT is a promising complementary treatment for dementia, particularly in enhancing cognitive function and alleviating long-term depressive symptoms. To maximize its benefits, further research is needed to create standardized MT protocols suited to different stages and types of dementia.

Efficacy of Musical Intervention in
Cognitive Function
Figure 2 summarizes the relevant results of the quantitative
synthesis of the effect of music therapy for people living
with dementia. First, we evaluated the effect of music
therapy on cognitive function by analyzing eight studies
(816 cases) (Figure 2A). In the random-effects model,
SMD was ‚àí0.23 (95% CI: ‚àí0.44, ‚àí0.02), which suggested
that musical intervention could be beneficial to improve
cognitive function in people living with dementia. However,
the trials showed very high heterogeneity [I2 value = 72%
(P < 0.0001)].
Subgroup analyses and meta-regression were used to further
explore this source of heterogeneity (Table 2). Two significant
sources of heterogeneity were detected: the trial period and
the intervention method (coefficient = 7.43, P = 0.006 and
coefficient = 3.981; P = 0.046, respectively). Interestingly, we
observed that shorter intervention periods (<20 weeks) and
passive interventions methods (listening to music) had greater
effect on people living with dementia than longer intervention
periods or interactive interventions, such as singing and dancing
(Figure 2A; Table 2). On the other hand, to play an instrument
does not seem to have a positive effect on cognitive function.
Nevertheless, it appears to be effective when it is combined with
singing and listening to music, without improving the effect
of just listening to music (Figure 2A). The funnel plot on the
publication bias across cognitive studies appeared symmetrically
low (Supplementary Figure 1 of the Supplementary Data).
Efficacy of Musical Intervention in Quality
of Life
A meta-analysis about the quality of life of people living with
dementia after the intervention with music therapy was designed.
The analysis included three studies (286 cases). The results
suggested that there was an effect on the quality of life of patients
once the intervention is finished (SMD = ‚àí0.36, 95% CI: ‚àí0.62,
0.10) (Figure 2B). On the other hand, no significant effect of
music therapy was observed when carrying out the analysis (two
studies; 166 cases) of the quality of life of people living with
dementia 6 months after the intervention (SMD = ‚àí0.34, 95%
CI: ‚àí0.78, 0.10) (Figure 2C). The heterogeneity of the studies was
small in the short-term analysis but >25 in the long term (I2 = 12
and I2 = 42, respectively).
Supplementary Figures 1B,C in the Supplementary Data
represent the funnel plot about the quality of life measured after
the intervention and 6 months later. Data indicate that there is
no publication bias.
Efficacy of Musical Intervention in the
Depressive State
Finally, in order to evaluate the influence of music therapy on the
depressive state associated with dementia, in both the short and
long terms, we analyzed its effect when the intervention had just
ended and 6 months after the treatment. The result of the meta-
analysis (5 studies, 342 cases) suggested that there was no short-
term effect on the depressive state of the patients (SMD = 0.16,
95% CI: ‚àí0.54, 0.87) (Figure 2D). However, when studying the
depressive state of patients 6 months after the intervention to
know if there is a long-term effect (4 studies, 290 cases), the result
indicated that music therapy could have a positive effect on the

DISCUSSION
The main objective of this work was to study through systematic
review and meta-analysis whether the application of music as a
therapy has an effect on cognitive function, quality of life, and/or
depressive state in a group of specific diseases such as dementia.
Nowadays, there is a growing incidence of this pathology in
the population (1), and therefore, it is necessary to develop
treatments and activities to relieve its symptoms. In addition,
there is not enough scientific evidence about the efficacy of
music as a therapy on the cognitive and behavioral states of
these patients.
Our results suggest that music therapy has a positive effect on
cognitive function for people living with dementia. To reach that
assumption, we performed a comprehensive systematic review
that includes eight studies with 816 subjects. We observed that
listening to music is the intervention type with the greatest
positive effect on cognitive function. This could be explained
because listening to music integrates perception of sounds,
rhythms, and lyrics and the response to the sound and requires
attention to an environment, which implies that our brain
has many areas activated. Those events are linked to wide
cortical activation (14, 15, 45). In addition, music training is
a strong stimulus for neuroplastic changes. So music could
decrease neuronal degeneration by enhancing cerebral plasticity
and inducing the creation of new connections in the brain
(46, 47). However, the heterogeneity presented by the different
studies included in the meta-analysis does not allow us to
reach reliable conclusions (I2 = 75%). This heterogeneity may
be due to the design of each study, the difference in the type
of intervention carried out, and the number of participants
among other variables (41). Meta-regression showed that the
intervention method, interactive or passive, is a significant source
of heterogeneity accounting for 45.1% of the total heterogeneity
detected (Table 2). We observed a significant effect on cognitive
function in the passive intervention group (P = 0.0004). This
result is in agreement with our previous analysis where listening
to music has the greatest effect. Other sources of heterogeneity
found when we analyzed the effect of music therapy on the
cognitive function were the intervention length and the number
of sessions per week (34.4 and 9.4%, respectively), the latter not
being significant (Table 2). Based on the literature, there is a
huge diversity in the scheduling of music treatment duration.
In our case, sessions varied from 90 min once a week during
10 or 20 weeks to 60 min during 40 weeks. It seems that
the length for the entire music intervention procedure might
be a crucial element for successful results and seems to be
associated with the intervention type (48‚Äì50). We observed that
shorter intervention periods (<20 weeks) had a greater effect
on people living with dementia than longer intervention ones.
This finding is not enough to draw further conclusion due to
the heterogeneity found. According to our results, although the
number of sessions per week seems not to have an impact on
music therapy effectiveness, a greater frequency of therapy seems
to be of particular importance (48).
Xu et al. and Roman-Caballero et al. showed similar results
in two meta-analysis studies conducted on musical intervention
in cognitive dysfunction in healthy older adults (18, 23). In
fact, as in our study, the level of heterogeneity found was
also very wide. Van der Steen et al. also analyzed music-
based therapeutic intervention on cognition in people with
dementia (51). They found low-quality evidence that music-
based therapeutic interventions may have little or no effect
on cognition. Nevertheless, they did not analyze the effects in
relation to the overall duration of the treatment, the number of
sessions, and the type of music intervention.
After analysis of the secondary outcomes, music therapy
surprisingly did not have a marked effect. Regarding quality
of life, our data suggested a positive effect once the therapy
is finished, but it was not durable after 6 months of music
intervention. On the other hand, the study evaluating the effect
of music therapy on the depressive state of people living with
dementia showed no improvement in the state of these patients
when they were evaluated after the intervention. However, if the
depressive state was evaluated after 6 months from treatment, a
shift in favor of music therapy was observed. This result suggests
that the effects of music are not immediate and that the design
of progressive and continuous interventions is necessary in order
to obtain successful results as has also been discussed by Leubner
and Hinterberger (49).
Xu et al. observed that, both in the analysis of the depressive
state and in the quality of life, music therapy does not have a
positive effect (23). These data corroborate the results obtained
in the short term in our study. However, they did not measure
the effects of long-term music therapy. Furthermore, Dyer
et al. found that music as a non-pharmacological intervention
improves behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia
but concluded that further research is required (2, 52). Van der
Steen et al. also compared the effect music-based therapeutic
intervention versus usual care or versus other activities on
depression and emotional well-being (51). Likewise, at the end
of treatment, they found low-quality evidence that the musical
interventions may improve emotional well-being and quality
of life.
Music is a pleasant stimulus, especially when it is adapted to
one‚Äôs personal preferences, and it can evoke positive emotions.
Some studies have demonstrated that music therapy had an
influence on levels of hormones such as cortisol. It also affects
the autonomic nervous systems by decreasing stress-related
activation (53, 54). At the same time, some studies suggest that
music promotes several neurotransmitters, such as endorphins,
endocannabinoids, dopamine, and nitric oxide. This implies that
music takes part in reward, stress, and arousal processes (55).
However, the lack of standardized methods for musical stimulus
selection is a common feature in the studies we have reviewed.

Moreno-Morales et al. Meta-Analyisis Music Therapy in Dementia
Additionally, the absence of a suitable control of the intervention
to match levels of arousal, attentional engagement, mood state
modification, or emotional qualities between participants may be
a reason for the differences between studies (55). Furthermore,
our results have likely been influenced by the type of test
used to evaluate depression symptoms. Most studies used
questionnaires that were based on self-assessment. However,
it is unclear whether this approach is valid to detect changes
regarding symptom improvement. Future approaches should
add measurements of physiological body reactions, such as skin
conductance and heart rate, for more objectivity (49).
CONCLUSIONS
This study shows evidence with a positive trend supporting music
therapy for the improvement of cognitive function in people
living with dementia. Additionally, the study reveals a positive
result for treatment of long-term depression, without showing an
effect on short-term depression in these patients. Furthermore,
music therapy seems to improve quality of life of people with
dementia once the intervention is finished, but it does not have
a long-lasting effect.
LIMITATIONS AND POTENTIAL
EXPLANATIONS
This meta-analysis had several limitations. First, there are
many clinical trials in development like NCT03496675 and
NCT03271190 (Clinicaltrials.gov), whose completion is
estimated to be in 2024 and 2022, respectively, which could
not be included in this analysis (56, 57). Secondly, there are
several important limitations in the design of the trials included.
First, some of the studies included had a very small sample size
(<100 participants), which means that they may lack enough
participants to detect differences between groups. Also, the
musical interventions and the method used to evaluate the
cognitive function and depression were diverse and make it
difficult to state clearly their benefit when compared to usual
care. The lack of standardized methods for musical stimulus
selection is a common drawback in the studies we reviewed and
a probable contributor to inconsistencies across studies (55).
Finally, we could not perform a subgroup analysis regarding
dementia severity to evaluate when music intervention would
be more appropriate in the disease trajectory. This was due to
the fact that in all studies selected, participants with different
dementia stage were randomly assigned to the intervention or
control group. Besides, almost all trials in the literature were
focused on the mild or moderate stage of dementia, and there
were few studies about people living with severe dementia.
However, those studies do not evaluate cognitive function (58).
FUTURE RESEARCH RECOMMENDATION
Despite the limitations, music is a non-pharmacological
intervention, noninvasive, and without side effects, and its
application is economical (53, 54). For this reason, in order
to confirm the effect of musical interventions, more clinical
trials on the effect of music therapy should be promoted. The
tests should include a high number of participants, be robust,
and be randomized. As explained, music therapy methods and
techniques used in clinical practice are diverse. Therefore, it
is necessary to design standardized clinical trials that evaluate
cognitive function and the disease behavioral features through
the same battery of tests to obtain comparable results. On the
other hand, there were no high-quality longitudinal studies
that demonstrated long-term benefits of music therapy. It is
also important to develop study designs that will be sensitive
to the nature and severity of dementia. Future music therapy
studies need to define a theoretical model, include better-
focused outcome measures, and discuss how the findings may
improve the well-being of people with dementia as discussed by
McDermott et al. (45). and many others (49, 54, 55).
The investment in research in this novel therapy could
lead to its implementation as a new and alternative
intervention together with current cognitive-behavioral and
pharmacological therapies

Summary and Analysis of the Meta-Analysis on Music Therapy in Dementia
Introduction:
The meta-analysis aimed to assess the efficacy of music therapy on cognitive function, quality of life, and depressive states in individuals living with dementia.

Cognitive Function:

Studies and Participants: Eight studies with 816 participants were analyzed.
Results: The standardized mean difference (SMD) was ‚àí0.23 (95% CI: ‚àí0.44, ‚àí0.02), indicating a small but significant positive effect of music therapy on cognitive function.
Heterogeneity: High heterogeneity was observed (I¬≤ = 72%), suggesting variability across studies.
Subgroup Analysis and Meta-Regression: Two significant sources of heterogeneity were trial period and intervention method. Shorter intervention periods (<20 weeks) and passive methods (listening to music) were more effective. Playing instruments alone did not significantly impact cognitive function but was effective when combined with singing and listening.
Quality of Life:

Short-term Effects: Analysis of three studies (286 cases) suggested a positive short-term effect (SMD = ‚àí0.36, 95% CI: ‚àí0.62, ‚àí0.10).
Long-term Effects: No significant long-term effect was observed in two studies (166 cases) (SMD = ‚àí0.34, 95% CI: ‚àí0.78, 0.10).
Heterogeneity: Small heterogeneity in the short-term analysis (I¬≤ = 12%), but moderate in the long-term analysis (I¬≤ = 42%).
Depressive State:

Short-term Effects: No significant short-term effect on depressive states was observed in five studies (342 cases) (SMD = 0.16, 95% CI: ‚àí0.54, 0.87).
Long-term Effects: A positive long-term effect was found in four studies (290 cases) (SMD = ‚àí0.25, 95% CI: ‚àí0.68, 0.18).
Heterogeneity: High heterogeneity in both short-term (I¬≤ = 89%) and long-term (I¬≤ = 66%) analyses.
Discussion:

Positive Cognitive Effects: The meta-analysis supports that music therapy can improve cognitive function in dementia patients, especially with passive listening methods.
Quality of Life and Depressive States: Short-term quality of life improvements were observed, but no long-lasting effects. Interestingly, long-term improvements in depressive states were found, suggesting that music therapy might have delayed benefits.
Mechanisms: Music therapy may enhance neuroplasticity, involve multiple brain areas, and affect hormonal and autonomic systems.
Limitations: Small sample sizes, diverse interventions, and evaluation methods contribute to study heterogeneity and limit the ability to draw definitive conclusions.
Conclusion:
Music therapy shows promise for improving cognitive function and has potential long-term benefits for depressive states in people with dementia. However, its effects on quality of life are not sustained over time. The therapy is non-invasive, economical, and without side effects, making it a viable complementary treatment.

Future Research Recommendations:

Conduct more robust, randomized clinical trials with larger sample sizes.
Standardize music therapy methods and evaluation measures.
Explore the effects of music therapy across different stages of dementia.
Focus on long-term studies to validate and understand the delayed benefits of music therapy.
Potential and Implementation:
The findings support the integration of music therapy into current dementia treatment protocols, providing an alternative and adjunct to cognitive-behavioral and pharmacological therapies. Investing in further research could solidify its role in enhancing the well-being of dementia patients.

Abstract Based on insights from brain research in music,
neurologic music therapy (NMT) has been established as a
new model for music in therapy and medicine. Standard-
ized clinical interventions are based on clusters of research
evidence and established learning principles in motor,
speech/language, and cognitive training. The research
support for NMT in stroke rehabilitation has been growing
rapidly over the past 20 years. This paper will review
research data and clinical applications for neurorehabili-
tation in the speech/language, cognitive and sensorimotor
domains.

Introduction
Over the past two decades, researchers have begun to
elucidate the neural substrates of musical functions in the
human brain. In our own research, rhythm perception and
production have been a primary focus of these efforts,
because they form the most important structural element in
the language of music. The study of rhythm has produced
insights into musical time processing and temporal infor-
mation processing in the human brain. These investigations
have led to a fundamental need to rethink the role of music
in therapy and medicine, tapping the capacity of music to
serve as a powerful complex auditory stimulus capable of
engaging the brain in retraining neural and behavioral
functions that can then be applied to nonmusical functional
contexts in therapy and medicine.
Traditionally, music in therapy has been based mostly
on social science models in which the cultural role of music
is interpreted as an effective facilitator for therapeutic
concepts of ‚Äò‚Äòwell-being, emotional response, and rela-
tionship building.‚Äô‚Äô Neuroscience research in music has
created new insights into the therapeutic benefits of music,
shifting the models of music in therapy from social science
and interpretative models to neuroscience and perceptual
models. That is, they are based on how the structures and
patterns in music engage the brain in ways that can be
meaningfully translated and generalized to nonmusical
therapeutic learning and training. In other words, the brain
that engages in music is changed by engaging in music.
This reciprocal relationship of music and brain function‚Äî
discovered in the mid-1990s within the larger context of a
very fascinating line of research demonstrating the expe-
rience-dependent plasticity of the brain‚Äîis one of the most
powerful motors of change in the historical paradigm of
music therapy. These new findings suggest that music can
stimulate complex cognitive, affective, and sensorimotor
processes in the brain that can then be generalized and
transferred to nonmusical therapeutic applications.
The clinical answer to these conceptual changes has
been the development of neurologic music therapy (NMT).
Unlike the traditional socio-cultural model of music ther-
apy, NMT uses the perception of auditory structures and
patterns in music as cues to retrain brain function. NMT
requires advanced certification training and consists of
standardized treatment techniques which are based on
clusters of research evidence in the areas of motor, speech/

language, and cognitive rehabilitation. In the following we
will review research underlying NMT techniques specifi-
cally addressing motor and speech and language recovery
in stroke rehabilitation.
Studies in Gait Rehabilitation
The first field of inquiry in which breakthrough data
emerged for a new understanding of the role and func-
tion of music in therapy came in motor-control research.
Several studies conducted since the mid-1990s demon-
strate impressively that rhythmic entrainment of motor
function can actively facilitate the recovery of movement
in patients with stroke. Early landmark studies by Paltsev
and Elner [1] and Rossignol and Melvill Jones [2] had
shown evidence for the complex physiological interac-
tions between the auditory and the motor system. Most
studies that appeared in the 1970s and 1980s had
reported beneficial effects of rhythm and music on motor
development and movement performance using behav-
ioral and motivational measures. Sensorimotor research
focusing on motor learning principles or physiological
mechanisms had focused almost exclusively on the role
of visual and proprioceptive modalities in the control of
movement.
It took the studies conducted by Paltsev and Elner [1]
and Rossingol and Melvill Jones [2] to show evidence for
the existence of auditory-motor pathways (e.g., via retic-
ulospinal connections) that could influence threshold
excitability of motor neurons, creating a readiness or
priming effect on the segmental motor system via auditory
input. Rossignol and Melvill Jones also demonstrated that
this priming effect could turn into a functionally facilitating
timing effect of muscle activation patterns during auditory
rhythmic cuing of rhythmic leg movement.
The first study investigating the influence of auditory
rhythm on gait was carried out by our group on healthy
subjects. The data showed a strong synchronization effect
between the timing of the beat cues and the leg movements.
Furthermore, from a physiological point, significant
reductions in electromyographic variability of the leg
muscles (gastrocnemius) became evident in rhythmically
cued gait of healthy subjects [3]. These data set the stage
for a follow-up study with hemiparetic ischemic stroke
patients 6‚Äì18 months post stroke [4]. Results showed sig-
nificant entrainment results using auditory rhythm as a
pacemaker. Basic gait parameters such as velocity, step
cadence, and swing symmetry all improved with rhythmic
cuing. In addition, EMG variability of the gastrocnemius
muscle was reduced significantly in the paretic leg,
showing more economical motor unit recruitment patterns.
For a better understanding of what mechanisms might be
driving the almost instantaneous entrainment effect and
associated improvements in functional gait patterns, we
carried out kinematic research based on digital video
motion analysis [5]. Results showed significant gains in
stride length and symmetry as well as reductions in lateral
center of mass (COM) displacement and increases in ver-
tical COM, indicating gait patterns closer to the norms.
One of the important outcomes of this analysis was the
change not just in temporal gait measures but also in spatial
kinematics such COM displacements. Using the entrain-
ment paradigm as the basis for a six-week gait therapy
investigation, we investigated long-term training effects
with rhythmic auditory stimulation (RAS) in patient sam-
ples entering the study approximately two weeks post
stroke. The study samples consisted of patients with right
and left hemispheric ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes in
the middle cerebral artery and internal capsule distribution.
Velocity, stride length, and stride symmetry were signifi-
cantly higher than for conventional NDT/Bobath based gait
therapy [6]. Besides improvements in kinematic gait
parameters, a central physiological effect of auditory
rhythm on EMG patterns was found in reduction of
amplitude variability of the gastrocnemius muscle. In a
larger international multiple center study (US/Germany)‚Äî
replicating the study in 1997 with a shorter intervention
period of three weeks‚Äîsimilar results were confirmed with
the exception that the magnitude of the changes in the
study groups were proportionally about 30 % smaller
compared to six weeks [7‚Ä¢‚Ä¢].
RAS has been researched by other research groups.
Similar data were found for hemiparetic stroke patients by
Schauer and Mauritz [8] and Schauer et al. [9] using RAS
during treadmill walking. A study by Ford et al. [10] found
significant improvements for gait and associated arm swing
in patients with stroke. Abiru et al. [11] found significant
improvements for RAS over conventional gait training by
physical therapy in stride and step length, cadence, and
velocity. Improvements in the symmetry index in patients
with thalamic lesions were not consistent indicating the
lesion site needs to be taken into consideration. Several
research studies by Roerdink et al. [12‚Äì14‚Ä¢] confirmed and
extended our previous RAS findings in gait rehabilitation
for hemiparetic stroke.
Taken together, the physiological data suggest that the
periodicity of the pulsed rhythmic auditory cue had a
modulatory effect on motor neuron activity entraining
neural activation patterns into more regular and more
synchronized patterns, resulting in more consistent timing
and motor unit recruitment. Because these EMG
enhancements were always linked with significant kine-
matic improvements, one can postulate that the rhythmic
cues were acting on centrally mediated mechanisms of
Curr Phys Med Rehabil Rep (2014) 2:106‚Äì113 107
123
motor control, possibly via resonance coupling of motor
neuron activation patterns to the physiological coding of
rhythm in the auditory pathway. Furthermore, rhythmic
time cues provide an anticipatory time reference for onset,
duration, and completion of movement. In several psy-
chophysical studies, we were able to show that rhythmic
motor entrainment is not based on entrainment to the beat
event but on period entrainment, i.e., the rhythmic time
interval provides a continuous time reference for the motor
system to map and scale the movement duration unto the
duration of the rhythmic cue. In the period entrainment
model, the movement endpoints can have some slack time
around the actual synchronization to the beat, allowing for
adaptive flexibility in movement control [15, 16].
Studies in Arm Rehabilitation
In order to extend rhythmic entrainment paradigms from
gait research to therapy for other motor functions, two
NMT techniques turn functional movements, e.g., in the
upper extremities or in full body coordination, into cyclical
repetitive movement patterns that can be cued by auditory
rhythm. Patterned Sensory Enhancement (PSE) regulates
functional movement by translating the temporal, spatial,
and force-dynamic components of movement kinematics
into sound patterns, similar to sonification patterns in high
performance athletic training (Schaffert et al.), and then
plays them back to provide feedback and feedforward
regulation for enhanced motor control. The second tech-
nique, Therapeutic Instrumental Playing (TIMP), maps
functional movements unto musical instruments (mostly
percussion, keyboard, or digital sound surfaces) and
engages the patient in practicing motions repetitively and
cyclically via musical instruments. Patient playing is often
cued by an external rhythmic cue for anticipatory time
control. TIMP offers three advantages over nonmusical
motor training:
‚Ä¢ Priming of the motor system due to the enriched sound
environment
‚Ä¢ Auditory feedback for spatial movement control
(knowledge of results from sound when the instrument
has been struck correctly)
‚Ä¢ Anticipation and timing structure for movement from
the external rhythmic cue and from integrating the
external cue (feedforward) with the patient produced
sound patterns (feedback)
Several studies have researched aspects of TIMP and
PSE successfully in hemiparetic arm rehabilitation for
CVA [PSE: 17‚Äì19‚Ä¢] [TIMP: 20‚Äì26‚Ä¢, 27, 28‚Ä¢‚Ä¢]. Whitall
et al. [20], Thaut et al. [17], and Luft et al. [21]
demonstrated increases in ranges of motion with increases
in isometric arm-joint strength and significant improve-
ments on several standardized tests of arm function. Also,
decreases in variability and increases in speed of move-
ment times were found, as well as‚Äîmost noteworthy‚Äî
smoothing of trajectory variability during reaching move-
ments. By studying the underlying velocity and accelera-
tion profiles during movements, a very important insight
into understanding the effect of auditory rhythm on motor
control was developed. There had been very strong evi-
dence that non-temporal movement parameters, such as
stride length in gait or movement trajectories of upper and
lower limb joints (e.g., wrist, knee), improved during
rhythmic cuing. One basic conclusion was that enhanced
time stability across the duration of the movement during
rhythmic cuing‚Äîby way of rhythm providing a continuous
time reference based on its period information‚Äîalso
enhanced spatial-positional control of movement. How-
ever, a conceptual link to connect temporal cuing to spa-
tiodynamic parameters of motor control was missing.
Analyses of the acceleration and velocity profiles of joint
motions during rhythmic cuing offered an intriguing
explanation by linking the different parameters of move-
ment control into an interdependent system that could be
accessed and modulated by time.
The consistent evidence for smoothing of velocity and
acceleration profiles of joint motions during rhythmic
cuing suggests that rhythm enhances the control of velocity
and acceleration by scaling movement time. Velocity and
acceleration, however, are mathematical time derivatives
of the spatial parameter of position. Thus, in working our
theory backward, we reasoned that by fixating time through
a rhythmic interval, for a movement from point A to point
B the subject‚Äôs internal timekeeper now had a precise
reference interval, with time information present at any
stage or moment of the movement. This time information
allows the brain to map and scale smoother parameters of
position change (i.e., velocity and acceleration) across the
entire movement interval (e.g., reaching target points in
space for arm movements, etc.). Changes in velocity and
acceleration profiles, however, must be reflected in the
position-time curves of the movement. This can be
described mathematically as an optimization problem. If
we assume that the brain uses some optimization strategy
to control movement, it is possible to show, in certain
cases, that such optimization implies scaling of the
resulting movement over time. The immediate conse-
quence of this assertion is that matching the period of a
cyclical movement to the period of an external timekeeper
will result in the regulation of the entire movement tra-
jectory. Once the time constraint has been added, the brain
is presented with a well-defined optimization problem: how
to move from point A to point B in a fixed time interval
108 Curr Phys Med Rehabil Rep (2014) 2:106‚Äì113
123
while maximizing precision and minimizing some objec-
tive cost function for the body associated with making the
movement.
Studies in Speech and Language Rehabilitation
From a biomedical perspective, two shared functions of
music, speech, and language are important: (1) the aural
and production features shared by spoken language and
musical vocalization in singing and (2) the ability of both
‚Äò‚Äòsystems‚Äô‚Äô to embed communicative functions in the
auditory modality. One of the earliest systematic applica-
tions of music to the recovery of speech function was
developed in the early 1970s by using singing with patients
who suffered from expressive (Broca‚Äôs) aphasia. The term
‚Äò‚Äòmelodic intonation therapy‚Äô‚Äô (MIT) was coined to
describe this technique [29‚Äì31]. MIT is the most frequently
used speech/language therapy technique used in stroke
rehabilitation.
There is a significant amount of research starting in the
mid-1970s showing the efficacy of MIT with non-fluent
expressive aphasia [32‚Äì47]. However, as a word of caution,
most of these research studies have been conducted with
small sample sizes due to the fact that it is not easy to find
homogenous study samples in aphasia research in terms of
lesion site and symptom consistency. Experiments by
Stewart et al. [48] used transcranial magnetic stimulation to
disrupt speech and singing. Left hemispheric stimulation
disrupted speech, but right hemispheric stimulation did not
disrupt singing. These findings raise questions about the
neural circuitry for singing, which may be more diffusely
located and, as such, harder to disrupt than the highly
localized speech centers in the left hemisphere. Several
studies, e.g., Belin et al. [32], Schlaug et al. [41‚Ä¢] and
Breier et al. [35‚Ä¢] have shown evidence for neuroplasticity
induced by MIT, rerouting speech pathways from the
damaged left to the language-capable regions of the right
hemisphere. Long-term MIT training may also show the
reverse, re-activating left hemispheric speech circuitry [32,
41‚Ä¢]. Modified MIT protocols have been also been pro-
posed and researched [36‚Ä¢] showing positive outcomes.
Recent research by Stahl et al. [43‚Ä¢] proposes that the
element of rhythm may be equally or more important than
the element of melody as originally has been thought. The
hemispheric shift was originally proposed as a putative
mechanism by the originators of MIT in the early 1970s.
The mechanism for the functional re-routing of speech
pathways was thought to be triggered mainly by the use of
melody and singing as core musical elements engaging
predominantly the right hemisphere. Recent work studies
show, however, that the element of rhythm‚Äîusing met-
ronomic pacing, rhythmic hand tapping, and rhythmic
speaking during MIT‚Äîmay be equally or even more
important to access right- hemispheric language resources.
The following elements in MIT may be considered the
main mechanisms engaging preferentially right hemi-
spheric networks for speech production:
‚Ä¢ In melodic-rhythmic intonation vocal output is slower
than when spoken. Singing is characterized by syllables
being lengthened, chunked, and patterned, contributing
to speed reduction in vocal output. The right hemi-
sphere is better suited to process slowly modulating
signals. Thus, translating spoken language into musical
prosody prefentially activates right hemispheric lan-
guage networks [49]
‚Ä¢ Processing of music engages right hemispheric net-
works, thus, helping to bypass damaged left hemi-
spheric language networks
‚Ä¢ Rhythmic pacing and entrainment predominantly
engages right hemispheric networks in auditory, pre-
frontal and parietal regions [65]
‚Ä¢ Left hand tapping activates right hemispheric language
networks since spoken language and arm gestures are
controlled by the same motor control network [50]
Studies in Cognitive Rehabilitation
One of the most promising applications of music to cog-
nitive training in stroke rehabilitation may be in the area of
musical neglect training (MNT) which is one of the stan-
dardized techniques in NMT. MNT addresses hemispatial
neglect and uses active performance exercises on musical
instruments (tone bars or drums) that are structured in time,
tempo, and rhythm, and are set up in appropriate spatial
configurations to focus attention of the neglected or unat-
tended visual field. A second application type in MNT
consists of receptive music listening to stimulate hemi-
spheric brain arousal while engaging in exercises
addressing visual neglect or inattention [51‚Äì53]. Very
interesting data were provided by Hommel [52] on the
beneficial effect of musical stimulation for overcoming
visual neglect as a result of right hemispheric lesions due to
stroke or traumatic brain injury. Music stimuli were
superior to other sensory and cognitive cues, such as
instructions and speech or tactile cues. The researchers‚Äô
rationale focused on the well-documented specific arousal
effect of music on the right brain hemisphere that is
lesioned in visual neglect states. This rationale would also
be well supported by the theoretically established link
between arousal and neglect in general, which has also
been confirmed by research data. Robertson et al. [54] have
shown that unilateral neglect can be dramatically altered by
Curr Phys Med Rehabil Rep (2014) 2:106‚Äì113 109
123
changing the functioning of the brain‚Äôs arousal system, and
have used these findings to develop other arousal-based
neglect training techniques [55]. Frassinetti et al. [51, 56]
have also shown that auditory stimuli can enhance visual
perception in neglect states. However, their data point to
multisensory neuronal integration as an explanatory ratio-
nale rather than generalized arousal.
In another music listening study, patients with neglect
show enhanced visual awareness associated with increased
fMRI activation of regions related to emotion and attention
while they listen to music they like but not to un-preferred
music or silence [57‚Ä¢‚Ä¢]. Van Vleet et al. [58] investigated
proposed mechanisms of cross-modal interaction to deter-
mine conditions in which auditory stimulation affects
spatial and non-spatially lateralized attention deficits in a
patient with hemispatial neglect. Whereas the results sug-
gest a benefit of both general alerting and cross-modal
spatial integration on visual search efficiency, the most
significant improvement occurred when the target and a
tone were both presented in contralesional space. A
research study in Japan by Noto et al. [59] reported that a
patient with left spatial neglect improved attention toward
the left side on a cancellation test after having trained
playing a xylophone which was reversely placed with
ascending keys from right to left. Using a similar training
method, Kouya and Saito [60] reported that patients with
left spatial neglect extended their personal hygiene activi-
ties to the left side of the face after training with a xylo-
phone again set in reverse and by having the patients play
melodies which emphasized ascending pitch patterns, thus,
moving attention and arm movement from the right side to
neglect left side (Fig. 1).
Abiru et al. [61] reported improvements in performance
on a line cancellation test and flower drawing test as well as
reductions in left side collision during wheelchair move-
ment after exercises playing tone bars in spatial arrange-
ments adjusted to the severity of patients‚Äô neglect. All these
studies employ similar protocols with exercises involving

Summary
Basic and clinical neuroscience research in music and brain
function has driven a paradigmatic change in music therapy
from a socio-cultural base, using interpretative models of
music, to a neuroscience base using active perception and
performance models. NMT has established evidence-based
therapeutic techniques to re-train and re-educate brain and
behavior functions in neurologic disorders and injuries,
particularly in the area of motor recovery in stroke [62‚Ä¢‚Ä¢,
63, 64]. Furthermore, neuroimaging studies have demon-
strated a clearly-defined network of parietal, cerebellar, and
frontal areas involved in the processing of rhythmicity [65‚Äì
67]. In this paper we have reviewed the research evidence
for motor, speech/language, and cognitive intervention
techniques in stroke rehabilitation. There is considerable
evidence that NMT is an effective therapeutic technique in
stroke rehabilitation.

Abstract
Neurologic Music Therapy (NMT), grounded in brain research related to music, has emerged as an innovative model in therapy and medicine. Utilizing standardized clinical interventions based on research clusters and learning principles in motor, speech/language, and cognitive training, NMT has shown significant progress in stroke rehabilitation over the past two decades. This paper reviews research data and clinical applications of NMT in the rehabilitation of speech/language, cognitive, and sensorimotor domains.

Introduction
In recent decades, research has elucidated the neural substrates of musical functions in the human brain, focusing on rhythm perception and production as core elements. These insights have necessitated a paradigm shift in the role of music in therapy and medicine, recognizing music's capacity to engage and retrain brain functions for nonmusical therapeutic contexts.

Traditional music therapy models, grounded in social science, emphasized music's cultural role in promoting well-being, emotional response, and relationship building. However, neuroscience research has shifted the perspective towards understanding music therapy through perceptual and neurological lenses. This shift underscores how structured musical activities can translate into therapeutic learning and retraining.

The Clinical Application: Neurologic Music Therapy (NMT)
NMT diverges from traditional music therapy by utilizing the perception of musical patterns as cues to retrain brain functions. This approach requires specialized certification and employs standardized treatment techniques backed by research in motor, speech/language, and cognitive rehabilitation.

Studies in Gait Rehabilitation
Pioneering studies in the mid-1990s demonstrated the beneficial effects of rhythmic entrainment on motor recovery in stroke patients. Studies by Paltsev and Elner, and Rossignol and Melvill Jones, revealed auditory-motor pathway interactions, influencing motor neuron excitability and timing of muscle activation patterns during rhythmic auditory cuing.

Subsequent research on hemiparetic stroke patients confirmed that auditory rhythms improve gait parameters, such as velocity, step cadence, and swing symmetry. Moreover, kinematic studies showed improvements in stride length and symmetry, and reductions in lateral center of mass displacement.

Studies in Arm Rehabilitation
NMT techniques like Patterned Sensory Enhancement (PSE) and Therapeutic Instrumental Playing (TIMP) apply rhythmic cues to upper extremity rehabilitation. These techniques have demonstrated improvements in range of motion, strength, movement speed, and trajectory smoothing. The evidence suggests that rhythmic cues enhance the control of velocity and acceleration, thereby improving spatial-positional control of movements.

Studies in Speech and Language Rehabilitation
Melodic Intonation Therapy (MIT) has been effective for patients with expressive aphasia. MIT utilizes the elements of melody and rhythm to engage right hemispheric language networks, facilitating the rerouting of speech pathways from damaged areas to right-hemisphere regions. Recent research emphasizes the critical role of rhythm in these processes, potentially more so than melody.

Studies in Cognitive Rehabilitation
Musical Neglect Training (MNT) addresses hemispatial neglect by using musical exercises structured in time and space. Studies have shown that music can enhance visual awareness and attention, particularly when it involves rhythmic or melodic patterns that engage the neglected visual field. Research supports the idea that music-induced arousal of the right hemisphere can improve cognitive function in neglect patients.

Summary
The integration of neuroscience into music therapy has revolutionized the field, shifting from socio-cultural interpretations to evidence-based therapeutic techniques. NMT has proven effective in retraining brain and behavior functions, particularly in stroke rehabilitation. The reviewed research provides substantial evidence of NMT's efficacy in improving motor, speech/language, and cognitive functions post-stroke.

Over the past 20 years as a music therapist and coordinator at Holland Bloorview, Andrea has seen first-hand the positive impact the hospital‚Äôs donor-funded music therapy programs have had on hundreds of her students‚Äô health journeys.

Not only do her students participate in playing along, they also build a sense of community.

‚ÄúAt first, in a group, a student might want to reach out and touch the guitar,‚Äù she says.

‚ÄúWhat we find by the end, they're not only reaching out and participating on the guitar, they're looking at their friend and they're having fun with their friend, while strumming the guitar.‚Äù

But for some of her students, playing traditional instruments, like a guitar, isn‚Äôt always an option.

‚ÄúWhat we find is in children with who may be limited in their movement, there may be a sense of reaching out or trying to grab and to explore, but it's difficult,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúSo we wanted to create an instrument that allows the child to be successful from the start, that was non-invasive, and that didn't require strength or the ability to grab.‚Äù

That‚Äôs why Andrea, along with a team led by Dr. Tom Chau through the Bloorview Research Institute, created the Virtual Music Instrument (VMI), a tool meant to create music through movement.

The VMI is an adaptable and accessible interface that makes music and sound, by using a combination of a webcam, a monitor, and virtual on-screen images. The interface works by emitting a sound effect or musical note when a shape on-screen is ‚Äútouched‚Äù by a student‚Äôs movements.

Whether it‚Äôs with a blink of an eye, a finger wiggle, a shoulder shrug, or a head bob, the program allows students with any ability to express themselves.

‚ÄúI zoom the camera on the part of their body they‚Äôll be using. Then the computer is basically mapping out the child's image and when the child moves through that particular shape, it fires off a signal to say, now play that sound on that instrument,‚Äù she says.

‚ÄúSo, children are able to play Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star just like anyone else in their class.‚Äù

From diamonds, stars, or squares to colours across the spectrum, clients are given full control over their musical experience. Similarly some themes of the program allow students to activate sound effects, like Star Wars or birds.

‚ÄúI have lots of kids, who have been here, when I first talked to them about who they are and why they're here, they might tell me they have a disability,‚Äù she says.

‚ÄúWhat I love is by the time we're finished, they're saying ‚ÄòI'm a musician.‚Äô‚Äù

And because of the positive impact on so many students' lives, in 2017, the team behind the VMI was awarded with one of Canada's highest honours: the Governor General's Meritorious Service Cross.

Lynn Lewis has a neurological disorder and uses music to help her regain the use of her arms.

She's not alone.

Research on patients who've suffered some injury to the brain that affects movement ‚Äî like stroke or Parkinson's disease ‚Äî have suggested that using music with the right tempo "can improve their walking ability."


Michael Thaut, director of the Music and Health Research Collaboratory at the University of Toronto. (Supplied)
"Music is part of the most complex auditory language the brain ever invented," said Professor Michael Thaut, who's at the forefront of research on how music can alter the brain networks to heal the body.

The former professional musician's research journey into neurologic music therapy started 25 years ago when he studied if music could be used as a tool or language of rehabilitation.

Music's rhythm has a very profound effect on motor system, said the director of the Music and Health Research Collaboratory at the University of Toronto.

"If you don't  have a sense of rhythm then your movement coordination will always be out of control."

Can music improve motor function?
He questioned if music's profound effect on the motor system could be harnessed to improve the motor function of patients who are neurologically compromised,

To find an answer, Thaut conducted experiments on patients who were suffering from limited mobility due to a stroke or Parkinson's disease.

Those experiments, he said, revealed that using music with the right tempo can improve their walking ability by synchronizing their movements to a rhythmic beat that gives them the timing for their movement.

We found that the auditory system can actually make up for some of the deficiencies in a motor system.
- Michael Thaut
The results were surprisingly positive, recalled Thaut.  

Thaut said they had stroke patients walk. "They had, you know, certain asymmetric walk ‚Äî very slow, very unsafe." 

But then the music was turned on, and the patients were told to "walk to the beat," said Thaut.

"All the parameters of movement almost instantaneously changed very dramatically."

When the brains of these patients were studied, they revealed that the auditory system in the brain is very closely coupled to the motor system, according to Thaut.

"We found that the auditory system can actually make up for some of the deficiencies in a motor system, and it gives additional information that helps the brain program movement and  ‚Ä¶ control the movement better."

Once a patient relearns how to move using music, and continues to exercise, they no longer need the music to regulate their activity, said Thaut.

"The most important thing to remember with any form of therapy is the brain says, 'Use me or lose me.'"

Music as a tool for rehabilitation
Calgary's Foothills Medical Centre is actively using music therapists to treat patients with a variety of ailments from depression to problems with mobility. Music is the medicine prescribed to help some of their patients get better.

On a recent spring afternoon, the sounds of music wafted through the corridors of the hospital. The source is patient Lynn Lewis, who suffers from a neurological condition, sitting in her wheelchair singing the Gene Autry classic, Don't fence me in. Accompanying her is music therapist Jennifer Buchanan on the guitar.

For Lewis, the singing brings back joyful memories of singing and dancing with her mum. It's what she needs to relax and lift her spirits in the dreary routine of her hospital stay.  

But the music is much more than a mood enhancer.

It is providing neurorehabilitation for Lewis, who is experiencing numbness that has limited the mobility in her arms.

Her music treatment includes playing various drums and noise makers to maintain the rhythm set by the music therapist.  Keeping up the tempo forces her to use the injured arm.

As Buchanan explains to Lewis, rhythmic exercise "gets your brain starting to be engaged about the function you are about to be doing."


Music and cognitive impairments
In the last 10 years, Thaut has expanded his research interests to explain how music can help patients slow down the progress of cognitive impairments in patients with dementia and Alzheimer's disease.

While it is well known that musical memories and their associated biographical information is preserved longer than all other types of memory, nobody could explain why that happened, according to Thaut.

In a new study yet to be published, Thaut's research team at St. Michael's Hospital took brain scans of cognitively-impaired patients after they listened to music they were familiar with and after they listened to music that was new to them.  

The brain scans revealed the long-term music memory activates a large part of the brain, including areas not affected by cognitive impairment. That means there are lots of reserve or backup regions in the brain where that memory can be accessed.

On the other hand, the short-term music memory only shows up in a network with only three or four regions  in the brain.

The brain maps show activation patterns during long-term familiar (red) and short-term familiar listening (blue).

"That network will probably not survive. It may be gone 60 minutes after they leave the brain scan. The traces are not that distributed," said Thaut.

In another part of the study, the patients listen to a playlist made up of their musical memories which they are required to listen for an hour each day for a month.  

At the end of the month when their brains are scanned, Thaut said, it shows better connectivity between brain regions. That means "we can maintain longer levels of functioning, but we cannot reverse the progression of the disease at this point."

Applying this research to treat traumatic brain injury with music is more challenging.

"The impact of the injury is very broadly distributed over the whole brain. So that means people with traumatic brain injury have multiple issues to deal with," said Thaut.

While music can help with mobility, unlocking the music solution to other areas of the brain affected requires a lot more research.

Music therapy has emerged as a powerful tool in helping rehabilitation patients regain movement and improve their overall quality of life. Research on patients who have suffered brain injuries, such as stroke or Parkinson's disease, shows that music can significantly enhance motor functions.

The Role of Rhythm in Motor Function
Michael Thaut, director of the Music and Health Research Collaboratory at the University of Toronto, emphasizes the profound impact of music's rhythm on the motor system. He notes that rhythm is crucial for movement coordination. His research, spanning over 25 years, has demonstrated that music can act as a rehabilitation language, particularly beneficial for those with neurological impairments.

Synchronizing Movement with Music
Thaut's experiments revealed that music with the right tempo could improve walking ability in patients with limited mobility due to conditions like stroke or Parkinson's disease. When patients synchronize their movements to a rhythmic beat, their walking becomes more coordinated and safer. This synchronization occurs because the auditory system in the brain can compensate for deficiencies in the motor system, providing additional information that helps the brain program and control movement more effectively.

Case Studies and Practical Applications
At Calgary's Foothills Medical Centre, music therapy is actively used to treat various conditions, including mobility issues and depression. For example, Lynn Lewis, a patient with a neurological disorder, uses music to help regain the use of her arms. Her therapy involves rhythmic exercises, such as playing drums and noise makers, which engage her brain in coordinating movements with the music's tempo.

Long-Term Cognitive Benefits
In addition to improving motor functions, music therapy has shown promise in slowing the progression of cognitive impairments in patients with dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Thaut's research at St. Michael's Hospital found that familiar music activates extensive brain regions, including areas not affected by cognitive impairment. This widespread activation suggests that musical memories are preserved longer and can help maintain cognitive functions for extended periods.

Challenges and Future Directions
While music therapy shows significant benefits for mobility and cognitive function, treating traumatic brain injuries with music remains challenging. The diffuse nature of brain injuries means that multiple areas are affected, requiring more complex and tailored therapeutic approaches.

Conclusion
Music therapy leverages the brain's intricate connection between auditory and motor systems to facilitate rehabilitation. By engaging patients in rhythmic and melodic activities, therapists can help improve motor functions and slow cognitive decline, offering a non-invasive and enjoyable form of treatment that enhances patients' quality of life.
