What is music therapy?

Music therapy is a discipline where trained professionals use music purposefully within therapeutic relationships to support development, health, and well-being. It encompasses various approaches and techniques to address physical, emotional, cognitive, and social needs.
What is an example of music being therapeutic vs. music therapy?

Music being therapeutic can be as simple as listening to a favorite song to boost mood or playing an instrument to relieve stress. Music therapy, on the other hand, involves structured interventions conducted by a trained music therapist to achieve specific therapeutic goals, such as improving communication skills or managing pain.
What is a music therapy treatment plan?

A music therapy treatment plan outlines the goals, objectives, and interventions tailored to meet the client's needs. It includes a detailed assessment of the client's abilities and areas for improvement, followed by a plan for implementing music-based interventions to achieve those goals.
Can you name and describe three music therapy interventions?

Songwriting: Songwriting facilitates the sharing of feelings, ideas, and experiences. It can be particularly beneficial for hospitalized children to express and understand fears or for individuals with terminal illnesses to examine feelings about life and death. It can also provide an opportunity for creating a legacy or shared experience with loved ones prior to death.

Lyric Analysis: In lyric analysis, clients explore the meaning and emotions conveyed in song lyrics. This can help them process their own feelings and experiences, leading to greater self-awareness and insight. For example, analyzing a "fight song" may evoke feelings of empowerment and resilience, helping clients cope with challenges.

Improvisation: Improvisation offers a creative, nonverbal means of expressing thoughts and feelings. It is non-judgmental, easily approached, and requires no previous musical training. Through improvisation, clients can explore emotions, communicate nonverbally, and experience a sense of freedom and self-expression.

What is music therapy?

Music therapy is a form of therapy where trained professionals use music to address physical, emotional, cognitive, and social needs. It involves various techniques and interventions to achieve therapeutic goals and promote well-being.
What is an example of music being therapeutic vs. music therapy?

Music being therapeutic could involve listening to music to relax or improve mood, whereas music therapy involves structured interventions by a trained therapist to achieve specific therapeutic goals. For example, listening to a favorite song to relieve stress is therapeutic, but engaging in songwriting with a therapist to express and process emotions is music therapy.
What is a music therapy treatment plan?

A music therapy treatment plan outlines the goals, objectives, and interventions tailored to meet the client's needs. It includes a detailed assessment of the client's abilities and areas for improvement, followed by a plan for implementing music-based interventions to achieve those goals.

Precomposed Music:

Precomposed music refers to pre-recorded or live music used in music therapy, either played by the therapist or listened to passively or actively by the patient.
It fosters shared connectedness, evokes memories, improves motor skills, and helps the brain associate familiar songs with people, places, events, feelings, and emotions.
Playing Instruments:

Playing instruments in music therapy does not require a background in playing an instrument.
It can be used in conjunction with singing, songwriting, or improvising and offers benefits such as enhancing fine and gross motor skills, coordination, self-expression, and confidence.
Examples of group music therapy sessions with elderly and children can be found in these videos: Elderly, Children's Hospital.
Summary:

Music therapy interventions are implemented to achieve specific healthcare goals, and no intervention is inherently better than another.
These interventions are applicable to all ages and diagnoses, although not all goals may be addressed in every session.
Most music therapy sessions utilize a combination of interventions throughout the session to best meet the needs of the individual or group.

PSYCHOTHERAPY APPROACH
Psychodynamic Theory ( Sigmund Freud, 1890-1920) - Jung, Adler
• Freud– Unconscious thought / connections to childhood / Free Association
Based upon the belief that human behavior is strongly influenced by
unconscious psychological processes, such as internal conflicts, impulses,
desires, and motives, of which we are largely unaware on a conscious level.
Focus: explaining the motives behind why people think, feel, and behave as they
do. Therapy is aimed at helping the individual gain insights or increased
awareness of unconscious conflicts, in order to develop more adaptive and
satisfying behaviors and relationships (Wilson, O’Leary, Nathan, & Clark, 1996).
BIOMEDICAL MODELS -
• Music therapists also collaborate with physicians,
nurses, physical therapists, and other health-care
providers to treat or ameliorate the physical,
biological, or neurological aspects of the disease or
condition.
• 1) Focus on the neurobiological foundations of the
human nervous system
• 2) Strong emphasis on music perception and active
music participation as a form of stimulation that
activates physiological and neurophysiological
processes in the body (which include affect and
cognition as part of neural behavior)
• 3) Belief that the unique structural and cultural
properties of music can be harnessed to access
brain and behavior functions to facilitate and to
promote healing and rehabilitation.
NEUROLOGIC MUSIC THERAPY
NMT is defined as the therapeutic application of music to cognitive, sensory, and motor dysfunctions due to
neurologic disease of the human nervous system. It is a standardized evidence-based approach and the
outcomes are measurable

ChatGPT
Guided Imagery Method:

Post-MTA training, this method was developed by Helen Bonny.
It involves using pre-recorded classical music to guide clients through imagery exercises, replacing the clinical use of LSD in the 1970s.
The method activates inner reflection and can be used to explore emotions and experiences.
Example videos: Video 1, Video 2.
Behavioural Approach:

This approach uses music as contingent reinforcement or stimulus cue to increase or modify behavior.
It is result-driven and therapist-led. For example, in the NICU, infants may listen to music as a stimulus to suck for nutrition.
Cognitive-Behavioural Model:

This model focuses on providing new experiences, reframing experiences, and replacing irrational thinking to promote positive changes in behaviour and cognition.
Psychotherapy Approach - Psychodynamic Theory:

This approach, rooted in the work of Sigmund Freud and others, focuses on unconscious thought, connections to childhood, and free association.
It aims to help individuals gain insights into unconscious conflicts to develop more adaptive behaviors and relationships.
Biomedical Models:

Music therapists collaborate with other healthcare providers to treat physical, biological, or neurological aspects of disease or conditions.
These models focus on the neurobiological foundations of the human nervous system and the use of music to activate physiological and neurophysiological processes.
Neurologic Music Therapy (NMT):

NMT is the therapeutic application of music to cognitive, sensory, and motor dysfunctions due to neurological disease.
It is evidence-based and aims to address various rehabilitation needs such as sensorimotor, speech and language, and cognitive rehabilitation.
Eclectic Model:

This model is client-centered, where the music therapist selects the approaches that best benefit the client within their scope of practice, training, and ability.
